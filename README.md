This piece of software was created by [Rafa≈Ç Toborek](https://github.com/clash82) with a cooperation of Brothers in Faith (check [contributors list](https://github.com/rBiblia/rbiblia-web/graphs/contributors)).

Everyone is invited to help make this software better and help to `spread God's Word over the world!`

## Development

Please refer to [docs](https://github.com/rBiblia/rbiblia-web/tree/master/docs) folder where you can find materials which will help you to develop locally. Please keep in mind that there is still a lot to do here (especially in the documentation part). It is recommended to text directly to Rafa≈Ç in order to get instructions on how to build project locally (use [contact form](https://kontakt.toborek.info)).

## Technical talk

App was created using PHP v8.1 on the backend with support of ReactJS v17 on the frontend side. We use modern (on the date of writing this note) dev-technologies like Webpack, JSX, SASS, PSR's, etc.

## Todo's

- add better error handling when dealing with response data
- add caching to avoid server querying with every location change
- implement tests (who cares about tests...)
