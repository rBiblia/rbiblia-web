Simple web interface to access rBiblia's built-in translations repository in an online mode. You can access repository at the official location under [https://web.rbiblia.toborek.info](https://web.rbiblia.toborek.info).

This piece of software was created by [RafaÅ‚ Toborek](https://github.com/clash82) with a cooperation of Brothers in Faith (check [contributors list](https://github.com/rBiblia/rbiblia-web/graphs/contributors)).

Everyone is invited to help make this software better and help to `spread God's Word over the world!`

## Development

Refer to the [official wiki](https://github.com/rBiblia/rbiblia-web/wiki) where you can find tutorials which will help you to develop locally.

## Technical talk

App was created using PHP v8.2 on the backend with support of ReactJS v17 on the frontend side. We use modern (on the date of writing this note) dev-technologies like Webpack, JSX, SASS, PSR's, etc.

## API Specification

Documentation for the API was created in OpenAPI format and is hosted [here](https://rbiblia.github.io/rbiblia-web/api).

## Todo's

- add better error handling when dealing with response data (display error message when something will fail)
- add caching to avoid server querying with every location change (if location was visited then keep it in memory and use it again)
