rBiblia Web
===========

Simple web interface to access rBiblia's built-in translations repository in an online mode. You can access repository at the official location under [https://web.rbiblia.toborek.info](https://web.rbiblia.toborek.info).

Check also standalone and more powerful desktop version of this application at [https://rbiblia.toborek.info](https://rbiblia.toborek.info/en-US/). Binary version is available in different languages (English, Polish and Russian) and works on Windows.

This piece of software was created by [Rafał Toborek](https://github.com/clash82) with a cooperation of Brothers in Faith (check [contributors list](https://github.com/rBiblia/rbiblia-web/graphs/contributors)).

Everyone is invited to help make this software better and help to `spread God's Word over the world!` 

Development
-----------
Please refer to [docs](https://github.com/rBiblia/rbiblia-web/tree/master/docs) folder where you can find materials which will help you to develop locally. Please keep in mind that there is still a lot to do here (especially in the documentation part). It is recommended to text directly to Rafał in order to get instructions on how to build project locally (use [contact form](https://kontakt.toborek.info)).

Technical talk
--------------
App was created using PHP v7.4 on the backend with support of ReactJS v17 on the frontend side. We use modern (on the date of writing this note) dev-technologies like Webpack, JSX, SASS, PSR's, etc.

Todo's
------
- add better error handling when dealing with response data
- add multiple languages support (currently UI supports only Polish language)
- add caching to avoid server querying with every location change
- implement tests (who cares about tests...)
